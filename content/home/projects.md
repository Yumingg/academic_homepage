## Investment Thesis

As a long-term supporter of new technology, I invest in ventures that make significant technical contributions. My focus is on technological innovations that have the potential to disrupt traditional business models or create new demands. Although I typically make only a few each year, I often lead the first round of funding alongside my friends when I identify a clear opportunity. I take pride in becoming the first supporter with technical teams that present unique insights into markets. Each investment is an interesting research project for me, and I hope entrepreneurs can think the same way.

## My primary interests

1. Next generation Internet Infrastructure and Applications. 
2. "Small-and-sweet" crypto native applications that further improve capital efficiency. 
3. Novel proof mechanism / Novel economical design 
4. AI agents with new business insights

Here are my investment portfolio selections.
